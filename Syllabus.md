## Course Description
Recommended: Successful completion of COMP B11 with a grade of C or better. DESCRIPTION: This course is an introduction to the organization and behavior of computer systems at the assembly language level. Topics include numerical computation, the internal representation of simple data types and structures, data representation errors, and procedural errors. Students will learn how to map statements and constructs of high-level languages onto sequences of machine instructions.

## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Describe computer representation of numbers and how computer arithmetic is
carried out.
2. Demonstrate understanding of the basic organization and operation of a digital
computer at a machine language level.
3. Write and debug simple assembly language programs.
4. Demonstrate how fundamental highlevel
programming constructs are implemented
at the machinelanguage
level.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The school policy allows up to 2 weeks of absences before I am required to drop you. If you are tardy, you will be assessed an absences for every 2 tardies. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in the colleges academic calendar under [Important Dates](https://www.bakersfieldcollege.edu/important-dates). It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, may be marked absent upon their early departure.
